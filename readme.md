This repository contains the materials I used for presenting at a Clinical programs/Services Brainshare in September of 2019.

If you wish to review or make use, I suggest beginning with the powerpoint.  It contains directions of how to go about how to make use of individual files.

The files make use of R and Jupyter Notebooks.
